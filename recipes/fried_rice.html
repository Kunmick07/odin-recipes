        <p>Cooking Nigerian fried rice is a process that's all about building 
            flavor. Unlike some other versions of fried rice, the Nigerian method 
            often involves cooking the rice directly in a well-seasoned chicken or 
            meat stock, which infuses every grain with a savory taste from the 
            start.</p>

        <p>Here is a general description of how to cook it, highlighting the key 
            steps and ingredients:</p>

        <h3>Key Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Long-grain parboiled rice is the most common 
                choice as it holds its shape well and doesn't get sticky.</li>

            <li><strong>Meat and Stock:</strong> Chicken or beef is often boiled 
                with spices like onions, garlic, ginger, thyme, and curry powder. 
                The resulting stock is the foundation of the dish's flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> A colorful mix of finely diced 
                vegetables is essential. Common choices include carrots, green 
                beans, green bell peppers, cabbage, sweet corn, and green peas.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Cooked and diced chicken, beef, or cow 
                liver are popular additions.</li>

            <li><strong>Spices and Seasoning:</strong> Curry powder is crucial for 
                giving the rice its characteristic yellowish-green color and a 
                distinct aroma. Thyme, seasoning cubes (like Maggi or Knorr), 
                salt, and black pepper are also used.</li>

            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Vegetable oil for stir-frying.</li>

            <li><strong>Onions:</strong> Sliced and used as an aromatic base for 
                the stir-fry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cooking Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Stock and Meat:</strong> Start by seasoning and 
                boiling your meat (chicken or beef) until it's tender. Strain the 
                stock and set it aside. You can then fry or grill the meat 
                separately.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong> The rice is not cooked in plain 
                water. Instead, wash the parboiled rice thoroughly and cook it in 
                a pot with the reserved meat stock. You want the rice to be about 
                70-80% cooked and slightly firm, as it will continue to cook 
                during the final stir-fry. This step is crucial for ensuring the 
                rice is flavorful. Let it cool a bit to prevent it from becoming 
                mushy later.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables and Protein:</strong> Finely chop 
                all your vegetables into small, uniform pieces. Dice the cooked 
                meat or liver. A mix of colorful vegetables not only adds flavor 
                but also makes the dish visually appealing.</li>
            <li><strong>Stir-fry the Vegetables:</strong> In a large pot or wok, 
                heat some vegetable oil. Start by frying the sliced onions until 
                they become fragrant. Then, add the harder vegetables first (like 
                carrots and green beans) and stir-fry for a few minutes. Next, add 
                the softer vegetables (like green peas, sweet corn, and green 
                peppers) and continue to stir-fry briefly to keep them slightly 
                crunchy.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the Rice and Spices:</strong> Add the cooked rice 
                to the stir-fried vegetables. Season generously with curry 
                powder and thyme, and add seasoning cubes and salt to taste. 
                It's best to add these spices to the vegetables first before 
                adding the rice to ensure the flavor is evenly distributed.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine and Fry:</strong> Stir everything together, 
                ensuring the rice is evenly coated with the spices and vegetables. 
                This process is a gentle "frying," which dries out the rice 
                slightly and toasts the flavors. Finally, add the diced cooked 
                meat or liver and any other protein, and give it one last gentle 
                stir.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer and Serve:</strong> Cover the pot and let the fried 
                rice simmer on very low heat for a few minutes to allow the 
                flavors to meld. The finished Nigerian fried rice should be 
                vibrant, aromatic, and have a beautiful, golden color from the 
                curry powder. It's often served as a main dish at parties and is 
                particularly delicious when paired with fried chicken, coleslaw, 
                or moi-moi.</li>
